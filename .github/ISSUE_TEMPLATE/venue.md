## Local team

<!-- 
  Do you have a local team? Can you present them to us in this issue?
  If you don't have a local team, please make it clear that you are looking

  Note that, in the current state of our organization, local teams
  are very much needed because the NixCon team cannot easily travel to your
  venue in advance depending on the circumstances
  to organize.
